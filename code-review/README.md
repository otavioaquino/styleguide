## Pull requests

* [1.1](#1.1) Always before opening a pull request make sure you run CSS and JavaScript linting.

> This will avoid micro reviews based on code syntax.

* [1.2](#1.2) Everytime you open a pull request make sure to let everyone on the team know.

> Use our `NS - Front End` Skype chat room or even our `#front-end` channel on Slack.

* [1.3](#1.3) Always before opening a pull request make sure the commit history is clean and easy to understand.

> Interactive rebase is our best friend and we should use it to enforce meaningful SCM history.

## Reviewing

* [2.1](#2.1) When reviewing code, make sure you add coments to specific line numbers.

> [GitHub has a nice feature to comment on the diff of pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/commenting-on-the-diff-of-a-pull-request).

* [2.2](#2.2) When reviewing code, make sure you mention the author and other team members involved on the implementation you're reviewing.

> [GitHub's issue mentions are awesome](https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions).

* [2.3](#2.3) After reviewing the code, if you think it's ready to ship, add a comment followed by one of these emojis: :sheep:, :rocket:, :ship: or :shipit:.

## Shipping

* [3.1](#3.1) A branch can be merged only if it has one or more emojis, from different authors, indicating it's ready to ship.

> This way we ensure that the code is going to be reviewd by at least two team members before going to production.

* [3.2](#3.2) After merging a branch, make sure you hit <kbd>Delete branch</kbd> button on GitHub's interface.

> It will help keeping things clean.

## Common sense

* [4.1](#4.1) Use your common sense when reviewing code. Avoid pointless discussions, [bikeshedding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality) and drama.

> This is probably the hardest one. Just try to be professional and kind.
